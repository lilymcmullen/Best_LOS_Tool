An ArcPy script for conducting visibility analysis and finding the raster with the highest visibility count. 
The code reads in an uncropped raster, a boundary polygon, and a feature class containing points.
It then crops the input raster based on the boundary polygon and finds local peaks in the resulting raster using the FindLocalPeaksValleys function.

The code then loops through each point in the feature class, creates a layer containing only that point, and runs visibility analysis using the Visibility function.
It saves the output raster with a name indicating the point ID.

The code then sets the workspace environment to the folder containing the output rasters and creates a list of all the rasters in the folder using the ListRasters function.
It then iterates through the list of rasters, converts the raster attribute table to a table view, gets the count field, and finds the maximum count value.
Finally, it saves the table view as a Pandas dataframe to a CSV file and prints a message indicating that the dataframe has been saved.

Then, the script will find the raster with the highest visibility count and print the name at the end of the script.
