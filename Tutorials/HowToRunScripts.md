In order to run the scripts, you will need to clone them from this repository to your ArcGIS Pro workspace.

### Step 1: Install ArcGIS Pro and Python

To get started, you need to have ArcGIS Pro installed on your computer. ArcGIS Pro comes with a version of Python, which you can use to run your scripts. Make sure you have installed the latest version of ArcGIS Pro and that Python is installed and configured properly.

### Step 2: Clone the GitHub repository

Navigate to the GitHub repository main page and click on the green **Code** button. Then, press **Download Zip**

Then, **move** the scripts you would like to use within the **scripts** folder and put them into a folder on your desktop. You can do this by **copying and pasting** the scripts.
### Step 3: Open ArcGIS Pro and create a new project

Open ArcGIS Pro and create a new project. Then, open the Python console by clicking on the **Python** button in the **Analysis** ribbon at the top of your screen.

### Step 4: Edit your script(s)

In order to run your scripts, you will need to insert some local variables. To edit your scripts, right-click the .py file and click Edit with IDLE (ArcGIS Pro).

If this option does not come up, right-click on your ArcGIS Pro desktop icon and press **open file location**. Then, open the **python command prompt**.

Now, all you have to do is type **idle** and press enter. The IDLE shell will appear, and you can edit your scripts from here.

Simply press **File** and **Open**, and navigate to the script you want to open.

If you are confused about what to edit, refer to the 'HowToFindFilePaths' and 'HowToFindYourDEM' tutorial files.

In each script, there are a few lines at the very top of the code which have comments telling you what to edit. Please paste the paths into those spaces.
### Step 5: Run your script(s)

Press **F5** and **Okay** to run your script! A shell window will appear, and in a few moments your results will be printed there.
