To run the scripts, you will need to input a few local file paths. This is so ArcGIS knows what spatial data to use and where to put your outputs.

Step 1: Open the Catalog Pane
To start, you will need to open the Catalog pane in ArcGIS Pro. You can do this by clicking on the View tab in the main menu and selecting Catalog Pane from the drop-down menu.

Step 2: Navigate to the Folder
Once the Catalog pane is open, you can navigate to the folder, file, or geodatabase you want to locate.
If it is not already in the catalog pane, right click on 'Folders' and 'Add Folder Connection' to import your desired file.

Step 3: 
Right click the desired folder, file, or geodatabase and select "Copy Path", or use Ctrl+Alt+P
