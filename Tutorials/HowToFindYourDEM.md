I generated digital elevation models for this project using OpenTopography, however you could use a DEM raster from any other source.
I found that the ***GeoTiff*** format works the best.

They have a wonderful (three minute!) [Youtube tutorial here](https://youtu.be/f1m-qa-6YXo)

And a [link to their website here](https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets)

Please note that you do not have to exactly crop your DEM, as the program will do that for you per your boundary polygon.
